**üìö Resume**

    This is a full C++ Oriented Object(OO) library for simplify PNG manipulations.
    This library designed to be tiny as possible, purpose severals functions that make easier Pixels Manipulations inside PNG images.

**üí° Features**

    - PNG decoder and encoder :
        ~ supports bit all possibles bit depths(8, 16)
        ~ supports various colors modes (grayscale, grayscale alpha, RGB, RGBA)
        ~ supports multiple IDAT chunks
        ~ supports PHYS additionnal chunk
        ~ supports all filtering and unfiltering modes (sub, up, average, Paeth)
        ~ supports dynamic scanline filtering, which gives which filter mode is better for reduce file size. 

    - PNG parsing, extracting wanted png informations(raw pixels datas, image dimensions, bit depth, color mode and channels number)
    - Hardware-independent processing, by auto-detecting endianess
    - OpenGL screenshot and save method
    - CRC32 computing algortithm
    - Exceptions Handling.

**‚öôÔ∏è Installation**

    Just copy the src, and include folder then copy it in your project directory.
    [Note] : Be carefull with the include mapping in src files.

**‚úîÔ∏è To-Do-List**

    - Support bits depths 16                                                                 [DONE] 
    - Using smart pointers instead on buffer pointers
    - purpose a saving mode(from no compress to high compress)
    - Decrease ouput images size : implement filtering methods, Now supports multi-threading [DONE]
    - Support color mode 4 (Palette)
    - Support auxilliary chunks(PLTE, TRNS, CHRM, ...)
    - compute chunk data error detection with crc 32-algorithm
    - support Adam7 interlacing method implementation
    - support extraction of meta-data in string form.


**üìù Notes**

    [Librairies] : zlib for defalte method implementation(only one managed by PNG format)
                   openGL for screenshot method. 
    [Important] :  Should be compiled as 32-bit due to zlib used library restriction(32-bit),
                   this can be easily overcome by using another deflate/inflate method implementation in 64-bits.
                   See doc folder for html documentation(generated by doxygen).
